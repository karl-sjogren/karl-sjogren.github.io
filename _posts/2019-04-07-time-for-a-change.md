Back in January the company I have worked for the past 6 years was bought by
the only real competitor on the market. While we spent almost all those 6 years
building our product Saga, a specialized CMS for public libraries, our
competitor threw together a product based on a generic CMS and called it a day.

So while I'm out searching for a new job I'm also a bit saddened to leave Saga
behind. We did some great things with our small team over the years, some basic
and some quite interesting, which is what made Saga exceptional for its purpose.

So my hope here is to write a series of posts describing some the little things
we've added to Saga during the years of development. Since this is a proprietary
product I won't be able to show much actual code for stuff that are not already
available (such as public javascripts) but I can still talk about the ideas and
concepts.
