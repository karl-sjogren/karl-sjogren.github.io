I heard somewhere that the internet was a bit crowded yesterday with everyone downloading Windows 10. Can't say that I noticed it when I got it myself.

For some reason I had a Swedish license for Windows 8.1 so I had to go through that to successfully update to Windows 10. The "Ta emot"-label would be "Recieve" if I had bothered to install the language pack before updating.
