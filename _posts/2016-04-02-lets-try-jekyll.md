Seems like it's time to move to a new blog platform again. I really enjoyed [Ghost](https://ghost.org) but there was something seriously wrong with my setup.

My old setup was Ghost hosted on Herokus free tier with binaries stored in AWS. It was fine when I set it up but then Heroku limited their free tiers and the AWS plugin started having problems uploaded images.

So enter [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and GitHub Pages!

This blog is now completely hosted in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/karl-sjogren/karl-sjogren.github.io) based on a simple theme called Contrast forked from [another GitHub repository](https://github.com/niklasbuschmann/contrast). No need for advanced setups or hosting providers!

It took me about 30 minutes to get going. I installed ruby, installed jekyll via `gem`, forked the theme repo and cloned it, then I just ran `jekyll serve --watch` from my terminal and I was up and running
So far it's been a blast and since my old posts were already written in markdown I just copied them over and updated the syntax highlighting markup and I was back!

Hopefully this ease of everything might encourage me to write some more, I've got some fun stuff lined up that might be interesting.
